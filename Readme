Geometric and kinematic modeling of Hexapod Leg
The objective of this project to control forward kinamatic motion of Hexapod leg. The deliveribles of the project is the simulation of the hexapod leg in forward direction. Along with it theoritical solution (Forward Kinamatics) of SCARA robot and double pendulum also been calcualted as a pat of the assignemnt.

Subcomponents of the problem involve:

Determining the desired controlled degrees of freedom (DOF) of the foot.
Computing the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) or Khalil formalism for the Hexapod.
Evaluating the Jacobian matrix.
Implementing the simulation of the Hexabot leg using MATLAB.
